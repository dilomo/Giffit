# Giffit - Gif animation tool for windows


Giffit is a small open source tool that was developed to streamline the process of making nice presentations here at ANKERE. It is very basic and easy to use but at the same time provides great value and sufficient functionally for fast paced design workflows. It is not intended solely for architects and artists but anyone that wants to make a GIF for web, chats, NFTs or any art. It's export engine is fast and produces files with good quality ([thanks to György Kőszeg](https://github.com/koszeggy/KGySoft.CoreLibraries)). Another benefit is that you can run it from your PC saving time from uploading and downloading results and also you can work with very large data set and images. Furthermore, you have the enhanced privacy of not sharing the data with third parties as Giffit keeps your secrets because it runs locally. Its operation is much easier than using Photoshop's animation tools as well.
